## Docker

* base image:
- definitely has an OS layer, and maybe other layers
- can be 'scratch' ?

* shell commands in dockerfile can be written in 2 forms:
- exec form (json array)
- shell form

* RUN vs CMD vs ENTRYPOINT
- RUN. Mainly used to build images and install applications and packages, RUN builds a new layer over an existing image by committing the results.
- CMD. Sets default parameters that can be overridden from the Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) when a container is running.
- ENTRYPOINT. Default parameters that cannot be overridden when Docker Containers run with CLI parameters.

* CMD: Provides default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT or a default command if ENTRYPOINT is absent.

* overriding params:
- CMD: Add arguments after the image name.
- Entrypoint: Use the --entrypoint flag.

* -it (tty interactive) options must be specified in order for shells... to run !

* to run a container without immediately exiting, it should have either 'cmd' or 'entrypoint'

* default entrypoint in a docker image is a shell

* from **Dockerfile** to running container:
```sh
docker build --tag <image_name> .
docker image ls
# docker image rm <image_name>
docker run <image_name>
# --detach: to run container in background
docker container ls
docker ps -a # to list all containers
# docker rm <container_id>
``` 


## Other

* check which shell is currently running:
- echo $0

* 'source' command: executes commands from a file directly within the current shell environment, rather than launching a new subshell, making it ideal for loading variables, functions, and aliases into your active session.

## Todo (dockerize)

* You must apply metadata to Docker objects.

* You have to take caution of unused object (often referred to as "garbage collection").

* Your Dockerfile must respect the Dockerfile good practices.
